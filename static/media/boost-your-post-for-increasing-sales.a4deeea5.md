Digital billboard advertising is the fastest growing advertising sectors, while radio media ad, print, TV revenues are declining.  Digital billboard advertising reduces the costs and increases the timeliness of advertising. Digital billboards are becoming the preferred choice of top tier advertisers because they are eye-catching from far away and with just a few clicks of a mouse you can place a message on hundreds of locations giving you the power to launch a widespread last minute campaign with little advance notice.

With formats like video and HTML, ads can be much more creative than a simple static poster. Movement, animation and even sound can catch a viewerâ€™s attention, and many screens include touch or mobile interaction for a more immersive campaign.

Unlike the four-week cycle of traditional billboards, a campaign on a digital screen can run for any amount of time. Brands also have the flexibility to target the ad to specific times of the day. So while the CPM for digital billboards is higher, it is often possible to spend less by carefully targeting the campaign to the specific times the target audience will be in the area.
