Billboards have been used since the early 19th century, following the invention of lithographic printing, that allowed cheap printing of large sheets. The earliest billboards were mostly to be found on the sides of buildings and have spread to roadside use following the availability of cheaper automobiles.

Billboards have a wide range of sizes starting from the small sized billboards ending in huge billboards. Billboard sizes range from the 1200mm x 18mm posters that you see at bus shelters to large 3m x 12m 96 sheet billboards on the side of the road and costs are accordingly.

Let's take a dive into the different dimensions of billboards.

1800 mm x 1200 mm
1.8 m x 1.2 m
5.905 ft x 3.937 ft
The may be relatively small but manage to make a huge impression in terms of impact. In fact, a 2014 study revealed that six-sheet adverts actively doubled brand recall, while boosting purchase intent by an estimated 47%. These figures prove that size certainly isn't everything in the deceptively complex world of marketing. With compact dimensions of just 1800mm x 1200mm, you will often see six sheet billboards at railway stations, bus stops and shopping centres. This means that they are very effective at connecting brands to a young and professional audience, while their compact nature ensures that they are usually found at eye-level too.

This helps to create a deeper level of engagement between your brand and the customer, with six-sheet adverts thought to be key influencers of buying decisions. This is certainly borne out by the figures, which underline the potential of smaller billboards and relatively compact adverts.
